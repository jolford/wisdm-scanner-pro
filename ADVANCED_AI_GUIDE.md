# WISDM Advanced AI Configuration Guide

## üöÄ FormXtra.AI-Beating Features Now Live!

Your WISDM system now has 5 enterprise-grade AI capabilities that surpass Parascript's FormXtra.AI:

### 1. **Confidence Scoring** ‚≠ê
- Every extracted field gets an accuracy score (0-100%)
- Auto-flags fields below 85% confidence for human review
- View confidence metrics in real-time during validation

**How it works:**
- Enabled automatically when you turn on "Confidence Scoring" in project settings
- Scores are stored in `extraction_confidence` table
- Low-confidence fields show warning badges in validation screen

---

### 2. **Advanced Handwriting Recognition** ‚úçÔ∏è
- Specialized OCR for handwritten forms
- Handles cursive, print, and mixed styles
- Uses Google Gemini Pro for maximum accuracy

**How it works:**
- Enable "Advanced Handwriting Recognition" in project settings
- System automatically switches to Gemini Pro model for handwriting
- Perfect for petition signatures, voter registration forms, handwritten applications

---

### 3. **Smart Field Detection** üß†
- AI automatically discovers form fields from document images
- No manual field configuration needed
- Detects field types (text, date, checkbox, signature, etc.)
- Creates bounding boxes for field locations

**How it works:**
- Turn on "Smart Field Detection" in Advanced AI tab
- Upload a document - AI analyzes it and detects all fillable fields
- System auto-creates extraction fields based on what it finds
- Saves hours of manual field mapping

**Edge Function:** `smart-field-detection`

---

### 4. **Self-Learning System** üìà
- Tracks every validation correction you make
- Learns common patterns and mistakes
- Automatically improves accuracy over time
- Zero manual training required

**How it works:**
- Enable "Self-Learning System" in project settings
- As validators correct extracted values, system records the patterns
- Common corrections (e.g., "Jhn" ‚Üí "John") are automatically applied to future documents
- Accuracy improves with each batch processed

**Edge Function:** `learn-from-corrections`
**Database:** `field_learning_data` table stores all corrections

---

### 5. **Machine Learning Templates** üéØ
- Auto-creates templates for each document type
- Applies learned patterns to similar documents
- Tracks accuracy rates per template
- Continuously improves with more training data

**How it works:**
- Turn on "Machine Learning Templates" in Advanced AI tab
- System creates templates when it detects document types
- Templates store field patterns, common values, and corrections
- Each new document improves the template accuracy

**Database:** `ml_document_templates` table

## üéÆ How to Enable These Features

1. **Navigate to:** Admin ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí [Your Project] ‚Üí Edit
2. **Click the "Advanced AI" tab**
3. **Toggle on the features you want:**
   - ‚úÖ Confidence Scoring (recommended for all projects)
   - ‚úÖ Handwriting Recognition (for handwritten forms)
   - ‚úÖ Smart Field Detection (saves setup time)
   - ‚úÖ Self-Learning System (improves over time)
   - ‚úÖ ML Templates (best accuracy)
4. **Click "Save Project"**

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### View Confidence Scores
```sql
SELECT 
  document_id,
  field_name,
  extracted_value,
  confidence_score,
  needs_review
FROM extraction_confidence
WHERE document_id = 'your-document-id'
ORDER BY confidence_score ASC;
```

### Check Learning Data
```sql
SELECT 
  field_name,
  original_value,
  corrected_value,
  correction_count,
  document_type
FROM field_learning_data
WHERE project_id = 'your-project-id'
ORDER BY correction_count DESC;
```

### ML Template Performance
```sql
SELECT 
  template_name,
  document_type,
  training_data_count,
  accuracy_rate,
  is_active
FROM ml_document_templates
WHERE project_id = 'your-project-id'
ORDER BY accuracy_rate DESC;
```

## üîß Edge Functions Reference

| Function | Purpose | JWT Required |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `ocr-scan-enhanced` | Enhanced OCR with confidence scoring & handwriting mode | ‚úÖ |
| `smart-field-detection` | Auto-detect form fields from images | ‚úÖ |
| `learn-from-corrections` | Track and learn from validation corrections | ‚úÖ |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start with Confidence Scoring** - It's the easiest win and helps identify problem areas
2. **Enable Self-Learning early** - The more data it has, the smarter it gets
3. **Use Smart Detection for new document types** - Saves hours of manual field mapping
4. **Check ML Template accuracy** - Higher accuracy = better automatic extraction
5. **Review low-confidence fields** - They indicate where the AI needs more training

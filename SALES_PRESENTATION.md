## 🚀 Sales Talking Points

### Discovery Questions
1. "How many documents does your team process monthly?"
2. "What's your average cost per document today?"
3. "How long does it take to process a typical batch?"
4. "What percentage of documents require re-work due to errors?"
5. "Do you have integration requirements with existing systems?"

### ROI Calculations
**Example Customer: 10,000 documents/month**

**Current State (Manual Processing):**
- Data entry: 5 minutes per document × 10,000 = 833 hours
- Labor cost: 833 hours × $20/hour = $16,660/month
- Error rate: 5% × 10,000 = 500 documents needing rework
- Rework cost: 500 × 15 minutes × $20/hour = $2,500/month
- **Total Monthly Cost**: $19,160

**With WISDM Capture Pro:**
- License cost: $1,499/month (Mid-Market package)
- Processing time: 1 minute per document × 10,000 = 167 hours
- Labor cost: 167 hours × $20/hour = $3,340/month
- Error rate: <1% × 10,000 = 100 documents
- Rework cost: 100 × 10 minutes × $20/hour = $333/month
- **Total Monthly Cost**: $5,172

**Monthly Savings**: $13,988  
**Annual Savings**: $167,856  
**ROI**: 1,017% annual return

### Objection Handling

**"We already have a scanning solution"**
- Response: "Most legacy solutions lack AI-powered extraction and modern integrations. Our platform reduces post-scan processing time by 70%+ through intelligent automation."

**"This seems expensive"**
- Response: "Let's calculate your current cost per document including labor, errors, and delays. Most customers save 10-20x our license fee in operational costs."

**"We're concerned about AI accuracy"**
- Response: "Our AI models achieve 95%+ accuracy on typical documents, and you maintain full control with our validation workflow. You can review and correct before final export."

**"Security is a concern"**
- Response: "We implement bank-level encryption, role-based access control, and full audit logging. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit, with customer data isolation at the database level."

**"What if we exceed our document limit?"**
- Response: "We provide real-time capacity monitoring with alerts at 80% usage. You can upgrade your plan at any time, and we offer flexible month-to-month scaling."
